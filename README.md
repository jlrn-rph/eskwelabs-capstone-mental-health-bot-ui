# Eskwelabs Capstone Project: BESHY Chatbot UI
This project is created by team JARDiS. We are a group of individuals from diverse backgrounds who came together as part of the Eskwelabs Data Science Cohort 11. In our capstone project, we collaborated to create a data-driven presentation on mental health entitled [Beyond the Numbers of Mental Health: Analyzing Reddit Posts on Mental Health in the Philippines and Developing BESHY (Bot for Emotional Support and a Happy You)](https://github.com/jlrn-rph/eskwelabs-capstone-mental-health).

This repository contains the code to provide a user-friendly and intuitive web-based interface for interacting with BESHY. The UI is designed to facilitate seamless communication between users and the chatbot, enabling individuals to seek emotional support and access mental health resources easily.
